## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** â€” The user sets up posts, captions, and schedule times through the Appilot dashboard or YAML config file.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot commands the Android device/emulator via UI Automator or Accessibility to open Threads, create a post, attach media, and set hashtags.  
3. **Output or Action** â€” The post is automatically published to Threads, and confirmation logs are generated.  
4. **Other Functionalities** â€” Retry logic, post verification, proxy management, and notification alerts ensure smooth, autonomous execution.  

## Tech Stack

**Language:** Kotlin, Python, JavaScript  
**Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Robot Framework  
**Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Scrcpy, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Accessibility Service  
**Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel task queues, Real device cluster execution
